   I am a <strong>finance major student</strong>. I like to learn French, guzheng and try new things. I registered my account on the Le Wagon because I wanted to constantly improve my computer programming skills and become a cool girl to adapt to the digital age!

   <h2>Finance</h2>
   <p>
   What separates <strong>finance</strong> from economics is the study of how companies, individuals, governments, and other institutions recruit and invest funds. The traditional research field of finance has two directions: macro-level financial market operation theory and micro-level corporate investment theory. I like the subject very much❀❀❀.

   <h2>Guzheng</h2>
   <p>
   <strong>Guzheng</strong> is a traditional instrument of Chinese Han nationality. It is one of the unique and important national musical instruments in China. It has beautiful timbre, wide range, rich playing skills and strong expressiveness, so it is deeply loved by the masses. I have been studying guzheng since I was four years old, and now it has been sixteen years. Learning an instrument helps to improve our patience.

   <h2>French</h2>
   <p>
   French and English are different letters or combinations of letters can make the same sound, in turn, the same letter or combination of letters can make different sounds, French has the same pronunciation and different spelling and there are many unpronounced letters in words, so knowing that a word is not necessarily spelled correctly, but French spelling is much more regular than English. Although I encountered many difficulties in learning French,I have make a lot of interesting French friends and get to know plenty of French culture during the process of learning French!
